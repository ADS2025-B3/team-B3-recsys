# Sprint 1 Kickoff Pack — ML-based Recommender System

**Description**  
In this activity you will work in **teams (5–7 students)** to set up your Agile workflow and deliverables for **Sprint 1**.  
You will start from high-level **Epics**, derive **User Stories (US)** (with Acceptance Criteria), and break them down into **Tasks**.  
You will also configure two GitHub Projects (Backlog & Kanban), assign owners, estimate work, and keep daily progress in the shared Excel.

**Goal**  
By the end of Sprint 1, your team will have a working process with traceable issues, a populated Kanban, and an initial ML/MLOps scaffold (DVC, MLflow) for the recommender project.

## 📂 Materials provided
- **STUDENT_GUIDE.md** — step‑by‑step instructions for Sprint 1 (Learning Outcomes, Agenda, Roles, DoR/DoD, Excel how‑to, GitHub setup).
- **ph_product_sprint_backlog.xlsm** — Excel tracker (Release/Sprint plan, Product Backlog, Burndown, Sprint Backlog, Task Slips, Retro, Self‑assessment).
- **labels.csv** — ready‑to‑import labels (type/domain/status/priority) for consistent tagging.
- **ExcelTemplate_Agile.md** — quick reference for the Excel tabs (what to write in each field).
- **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/** — Issue Forms for **Epics**, **User Stories**, and **Tasks** (drop this folder into your repo).

> Note: Place `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` under a folder named **.github** (spelled exactly).

## ✅ What you will do (at a glance)
1. **Create your team repo** in the Organization and add the basic structure (see `STUDENT_GUIDE.md`).  
2. **Add Issue Templates** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`) and **import labels** using `labels.csv`.  
3. **Create two GitHub Projects**:  
   - **Product Backlog** — Epics & US as *draft issues* (with Story Points, Priority).  
   - **Sprint 1 Kanban** — Tasks as *issues* (each with one assignee and hour estimates).  
4. **Seed the Backlog**: write Epics → derive **User Stories** (no AC on Epics; AC only on US).  
5. **Sprint Planning**: select US for Sprint 1, estimate SP, split into Tasks (≤ 8h), assign owners.  
6. **Track daily progress** in the Excel (one row per student‑day; keep Kanban in sync).  
7. **Retro & Self‑assessment** at the end of the sprint; record actions for Sprint 2.

## ℹ️ Submission & evaluation 
- Keep boards current (no unassigned tasks; WIP limited).  
- Excel aligns with issues (remaining hours, owners, status).  
- PRs reviewed; pipelines reproducible (DVC/MLflow runnable end‑to‑end).  

For detailed steps and examples, see **STUDENT_GUIDE.md**.
